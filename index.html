				<h2>About Me</h2><hr>
				<img src="assets/images/cuneyt_akcay.jpg" id="profile-image" alt="Cuneyt Akcay">
				<p>Hello! My name is Cuneyt. I know it is hard to guess how to pronounce it. I am a big fan of <strong>user-friendly</strong> designs. So, I will make a <strong>user-friendly</strong> version of my name for you. Just pronounce it as you pronounce <strong>June8</strong>.</p>

				<p>Currently I work as a computer science teacher and teach middle schoolers Scratch programming. I am attending University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp to become a full stack web developer. When I am ready, I will let you know that you can hire me.</p>

				<p>Well, I did not know what else I could write about myself, because I am a modest person who does not want to talk about his qualities, and I asked my wife what I should write about myself. She said I am the best, and I am very funny. And she said I love her very very much.</p>
